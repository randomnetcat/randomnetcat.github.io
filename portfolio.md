# Jason's Basic Portfolio

Hello there! I'm Jason. This is a basic list of the things that I've done that I think are worth sharing.

## Nomic-Related Things

I am currently the Rulekeepor and Assessor for [Agora Nomic](https://agoranomic.org/), and I maintain AgoraBot, a Discord
bot for the Agora chat server. The repositories for those projects are listed below.

* [Rulekeepor](https://github.com/agoranomic/ruleset): report generation.
* [Assessor](https://github.com/AgoraNomic/assessor/): report generation. There's also some statistics and graph generation in the `thesis` branch (merging to main is currently waiting on [an upstream PR](https://github.com/JetBrains/lets-plot/pull/455).
* [AgoraBot](https://github.com/randomnetcat/agorabot): discord bot.

### Writeups

In addition to writing code for report generation, I've made a few writeups analyzing data from Agora:
* [Ruleset Thesis](https://agoranomic.org/ruleset-thesis): 2019 writeup on the dependencies between rules
* [Assessor Thesis](https://randomcat.org/assessor-thesis): 2021 writeup on voting patterns

## Other Things

* I made [flowchart for the C++20 initialization rules](https://randomnetcat.github.io/cpp_initialization/initialization.svg) (not a blank page, scroll right + down) to
  assist with determining what the very complicated rules should do in a given circumstance and to assist with standard pedantry.
  This was made using GNU M4 to preprocess a hand-written source file into Graphviz code, which is then passed to `dot`.
